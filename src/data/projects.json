        "description": "I created ‘Jack’ as a personal project to measure how much I’d grown in 3D modeling, texturing, rigging, and animation over the course of a year. Starting with a cartoony-yet-realistic concept, I refined the character in Maya, experimented with ZBrush and Mudbox for detailing and texturing, and finally composited multiple renders in After Effects. <br><br>While challenging, especially with hair creation and displacement/normal map workflows, the project was a valuable learning experience that significantly improved my approach to topology, texture painting, and advanced rigging. Read more about it in my <a href='https://curbsider.blogspot.com/2010/08/progress-jack.html' target='_blank'>blog post</a>.",
