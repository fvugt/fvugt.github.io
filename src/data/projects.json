        "description": "For <a href='https://www.stapferhaus.ch/en/' target='_blank'>Stapferhaus</a> in Lenzburg, we created several interactive installations that dare the visitor to think about fake items, news, and lies. One installation is a multiplayer based team game where two teams can playfully see who's better at fact-checking. Another one is an archive of lies where through scanning real packages, the visitor gets to vote how severe a lie is, which is all hooked up to a database to see which lies are the worst, and which that are necessary.",
